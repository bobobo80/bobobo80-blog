I open my eyes I see your face  
I cannot hide i can't erase  
the way you make me feel inside  
you complete me girl, that's why  
something about you makes me feel  
baby my heart wants to reveal  
I'm down on my knees, i'm asking you  
so these three words I wanna hear from you  
  
yes I will, take your hand and walk with you  
yes I will, so these three words I promise to  
yes I will, give you everything you need  
and someday start a family with you  
yes I will, take your hand and walk with you  
yes I will, baby I promise to  
yes I will, give you everything you need  
and someday start a family with you  
  
oh yes I will  
  
this is no ordinary love  
and I can never have enough  
of all the things you've given to me  
my heart , my soul , my everything  
every night I thank you lord(I thank you lord)  
for giving me the strength to love her more  
and more each day I promise her  
as long as I hear those three words  
  
yes I will, take your hand and walk with you  
yes I will, so these three words I promise to  
yes I will, give you everything you need  
and someday start a family with you  
yes I will, take your hand and walk with you  
yes I will, baby I promise to  
yes I will, give you everything you need  
and someday start a family with you  
  
I stand beside you, in everything you do  
wherever you go, whatever you do  
baby I'll be there (oh baby I will be there)  
as god as my witness I will carry this through  
till death do us part, I promise to you  
  
yes I will, take your hand and walk with you  
yes I will, baby baby yes I promise to  
yes I will, give you everything you need  
and start a family with you, baby  
yes I will  
yes I will  
yes I will, I promise you  
everything's gonna be all right  
it's gonna be all right  
I will
